While seeing your typing speed from a programmed typing tests can be exciting, many of the popular typing speed test websites use random, simple words from a small selection from the english dictionary, which can lead to an inaccurate and unrealistic result. 

Use the Daily Typer Chrome Extension to see what your true typing speed is from your daily typing activities like typing a Tweet, Facebook post, email, or even an essay! 

Test the accuracy of this extension's typing speed algorithm by using the extension on a traditional typing test like monkeytype.com.
